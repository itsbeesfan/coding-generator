# CODING PROJECT IDEA GENERATOR 

This website generates a variety of coding projects based on criteria that the user selects. 
It's an easy and accessible way for people to find ideas for coding.

## Features
- Dark Mode
- Can select skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Can type technologies you want to use (JavaScript, Firebase, Node.js, etc.)
- Can select the type of project (web development or mobile app)

**If you leave all the criteria empty it will randomly select ideas from the json**

## Thanks and Getting Started
Work in progress (maybe, if people like this enough I might add more projects to the list, add more themes and more criteria.) **Suggestions and feedback are always happily accepted!**

(Thanks to Hackclub's High Seas for motivating me to build projects over the last couple of weeks!)
